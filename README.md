# ICPCCL

## 1. What is ICPCCL?
ICPCCL (Invernal Competitive Programming Camp in Chile) is a 9-day bootcamp designed to prepare us for the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). During the bootcamp, we solve various problems and explore a wide range of algorithms, all while teaching and using the C++ language.

## 2. What is ICPC?
The [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is an annual international competitive programming competition for university students. Teams of three students collaborate to solve challenging algorithmic problems in a limited amount of time.

## 3. Repository Purpose
This repository is primarily intended to house my solutions to the problems I have addressed during my preparation for the ICPC. It is also intended to serve as a resource for those who wish to study and prepare for the competition. Feel free to review the solutions, make suggestions, and contribute your own solutions.

## 4. My Experience
During my participation in the ICPCCL, I faced challenges that pushed me to hone my time management skills and develop effective strategies to solve complex problems. I learned the importance of teamwork by collaborating with my peers on challenging projects. For the future, I would like to improve in competitive programming and aspire to participate in the international ICPC competition.
